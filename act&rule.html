For this purpose, the Board has framed certain guidelines according to which the AWO has to submit the registration certificate under the Societies Registration Act or Trust Act, Audited Statement of Accounts and Annual Reports for the last three years, two copies of Memorandum of Association/Bye-laws and Animal Welfare Activities Report. The AWO has to agree to nominate a representative of the AWBI on its Managing/Executive Committee and also for regular inspection of its functioning. The new organizations are inspected by Board Members/authorized Inspection Agencies and if the inspection report is satisfactory, then they are considered for grant of recognition.</h3>
<h4> Financial Assistance </h4> 
 <li> One of the most important functions of the Board is to provide financial assistance to the recognised Animal Welfare Organisations(AWOs). The applications in the prescribed format received from the AWOs are scrutinized and eligible applications are placed before the Board for sanction of grant. Financial Assistance is released in two instalments after obtaining audited statement of accounts and utilisation certificate for the earlier grants and satisfactory Inspection reports. The Board provides financial assistance to AWOs under various schemes viz. Regular Grant, Cattle Rescue Grant, Provision of Shelter House for looking after the Animals, Animal Birth Control (ABC) Programme, Provision of Ambulance for the animals in distress and Natural Calamity grant.</li>
